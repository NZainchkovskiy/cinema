**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items passed on first validation. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P3) with independent test criteria
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering all user scenarios
- Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Well-defined edge cases
- Detailed assumptions section clarifying scope boundaries
- No clarifications needed - all reasonable defaults applied

## Notes

No issues found. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if additional refinement is desired.
