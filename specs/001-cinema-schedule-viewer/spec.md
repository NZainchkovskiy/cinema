# Feature Specification: Cinema Schedule Viewer

**Feature Branch**: `001-cinema-schedule-viewer`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application for viewing cinema schedule. Cinema has several halls. User should be able to see all movies currently displaying in the cinema, all halls, and movies schedule by halls and halls schedule by movies. For today and a week ahead. No need for admin part, all data should be hardcoded json data files. All images (movie covers etc) can be just public static images (or be at remote hosting)."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse Current Movies (Priority: P1)

A cinema visitor wants to quickly see what movies are currently showing at the cinema to decide what to watch.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - showing available movies. Without this, the application has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the application and verifying a list of movies with details (title, cover image, genre, duration, rating) is displayed, delivering immediate value to users wanting to know what's playing.

**UX Flow**:
- User opens application
- Immediately sees a grid/list of all currently showing movies
- Each movie displays: cover image, title, genre, duration, rating
- User can click on a movie to see more details and showtimes

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is opened, **When** the user views the main screen, **Then** all currently showing movies are displayed with their cover images and basic information
2. **Given** multiple movies are showing, **When** the user views the movie list, **Then** movies are organized in a clear, scannable format (grid or list)
3. **Given** a movie has an image, **When** the movie is displayed, **Then** the cover image loads correctly

### User Story 2 - View Movie Schedule by Hall (Priority: P2)

A visitor wants to see the complete schedule for a specific cinema hall to understand what's playing there throughout the day.

**Why this priority**: Enables users to plan their visit based on hall preferences (e.g., size, location) or to understand hall utilization.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a hall from the hall list and verifying that all showtimes for that hall are displayed chronologically for today and the upcoming week.

**UX Flow**:
- User navigates to halls section
- User sees list of all cinema halls (with basic info like capacity, features)
- User selects a specific hall
- System displays chronological schedule showing: date, time, movie title, duration
- Schedule covers today through 7 days ahead

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the halls view is open, **When** the user views the hall list, **Then** all cinema halls are displayed with identifying information
2. **Given** a hall is selected, **When** the schedule loads, **Then** all showtimes for that hall are displayed in chronological order
3. **Given** a hall schedule is displayed, **When** the user views the dates, **Then** schedules are shown for today and up to 7 days ahead
4. **Given** multiple movies play in one hall, **When** viewing the schedule, **Then** each showtime clearly indicates which movie is playing

### User Story 3 - View Hall Schedule by Movie (Priority: P2)

A visitor has decided on a specific movie and wants to see all available showtimes across all halls to choose the most convenient time and location.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary use case for decision-making - once a user knows what to watch, they need to find when and where.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a movie and verifying that all showtimes across all halls are displayed, grouped by date, enabling the user to choose a convenient screening.

**UX Flow**:
- User selects a movie (from movie list or movie detail page)
- System displays all showtimes for this movie across all halls
- Showtimes are grouped by date
- Each showtime shows: date, time, hall name
- Schedule covers today through 7 days ahead

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a movie is selected, **When** the user views showtimes, **Then** all screenings of that movie are displayed across all halls
2. **Given** showtimes are displayed, **When** the user views the schedule, **Then** showtimes are grouped by date for easy scanning
3. **Given** a movie plays in multiple halls, **When** viewing showtimes, **Then** each showtime clearly indicates which hall it's in
4. **Given** today is selected, **When** viewing showtimes, **Then** both past and future showtimes for today are visible (or only future showtimes if past ones are filtered)

### User Story 4 - Filter Schedule by Date (Priority: P3)

A visitor planning ahead wants to see the schedule for a specific future date to plan their cinema visit in advance.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience for planning but not essential for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting different dates (today through 7 days ahead) and verifying schedules update to show only showtimes for that date.

**UX Flow**:
- User sees date selector/filter (today + 7 days)
- User selects a specific date
- All schedule views update to show only showtimes for selected date
- Default view is "today"

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** any schedule view is open, **When** the user selects a date, **Then** only showtimes for that date are displayed
2. **Given** the date filter is active, **When** the user switches between different views (by movie, by hall), **Then** the date filter persists
3. **Given** the application is opened, **When** no date is selected, **Then** today's schedule is displayed by default

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a hall has no scheduled movies for a given date?
- What happens when a movie has no scheduled showtimes for a given date?
- How does the system handle movies that end their run partway through the 7-day window?
- What happens if movie cover images fail to load or are missing?
- How are showtimes displayed when they span across midnight (late-night screenings)?
- What happens when multiple movies have the same start time in different halls?

- Users access the application during normal planning hours (not requiring real-time showtime updates)
- Cover images are appropriately sized and optimized (not raw high-resolution files)
