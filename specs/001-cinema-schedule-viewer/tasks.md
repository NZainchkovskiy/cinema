# Tasks: Cinema Schedule Viewer

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-cinema-schedule-viewer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Per hackathon constitution, automated tests are NOT required unless explicitly requested. Focus on manual testing of user flows instead.

**UX Polish**: Each user story MUST include a visual polish task after implementation (spacing, alignment, feedback states).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project SPA**: `src/` at repository root
- TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/`
- Components in `src/components/`
- Routes in `src/routes/`
- Services in `src/services/`

<!--
  ============================================================================
  Cinema Schedule Viewer - Single Page Application
  Tech Stack: React 19.2, Vite 7.x, shadcn/ui, Tanstack Router v1, Tailwind CSS
  Data: Static JSON files served from public directory
  ============================================================================
-->

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Combined Schedule (Phase 7)**: Benefits from but doesn't require other user stories
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Benefits from US1 components but independent
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances all other stories but independent

### Within Each User Story

- TypeScript interfaces before components
- Components before routes
- Core implementation before error handling and feedback states
- Visual polish pass after functional implementation
- Manual testing validation before marking story complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel
- Component creation tasks marked [P] within each story can run in parallel
- Visual polish tasks across stories marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all component creation for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create MovieCard component in src/components/cinema/MovieCard.tsx"
Task: "Create movie list route in src/routes/movies/index.tsx"
Task: "Create MovieDetail component in src/components/cinema/MovieDetail.tsx"

# After implementation, launch polish tasks together:
Task: "Visual polish pass: card hover effects, consistent spacing"
Task: "Ensure responsive grid layout"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (~30 minutes)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (~45 minutes) - CRITICAL blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (~1-2 hours)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready - users can browse movies!

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP - Browse Movies!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Hall Schedules added!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Movie Showtimes added!)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Date Filtering added!)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Browse Movies)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Hall Schedules)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Movie Showtimes)
3. Developer D can add User Story 4 (Date Filtering) to enhance all views
4. All developers collaborate on Polish phase

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within the phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and manually testable
- Visual polish is mandatory for each story - don't skip it
- Manual testing after each story is complete - walk through the user flow
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Remember: Speed + UX + Visual Polish > Tests + Performance (per hackathon constitution)
